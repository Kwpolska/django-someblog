SomeBlog for Django
===================

This is yet another blog engine for Django.

Goals:

* learning how to write a Django blog like this
* support for stuff like RSS and tags
* posts written in Markdown, or with some WYSIWYG editor?
* comments, stored locally, and reusable in different projects

Non-goals:

* being cooler than `Nikola <https://getnikola.com/>`_
* replacing Nikola on my blog, or anywhere
